        <p style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif">In-N-Out Burger is a well-known American burger chain. I know this brand because my friends around me say it is delicious, but I have never eaten it. Because the scale of business, In-N-Out Burger is not comparable to McDonald's, Burger King and so on, most of its stores are located in California. But I've never been to California, so I've never eaten it. Those of you who have eaten it can tell me how you like it with BUTTON at the bottom of website. If I get the chance I will definitely try it!</p>

        <p style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">Five Guys is more common than In-N-Out. I can often see stores in many cities in the US, even abroad. Five Guys also went international last year by opening a store in Shanghai. I ate there once and I thought it tasted great!</p>
